# Day-night-world-map-matlab
Calculates where in the world it is the day time and where is night. This is done in Matlab using the NOAA sun position calculations. The programme generates still images at given timepoints which can then be combined into videos. The below example is a short snippet from late summer with a interval of 4 hours between images.
